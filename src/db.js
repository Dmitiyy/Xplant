        description: 'A cactus is a kind of a plant adapted to hot, dry climates. Plants which live this kind of life-style are called xerophytes. Most are succulents, which store water. Cacti are members of the plant family Cactaceae, in the order Caryophyllales. There are about 127 genera, with over 1750 known species. Almost all of them are native to the Americas, from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north. The species Rhipsalis baccifera also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.[3] Theophrastus was the first to use the word cactus: It comes from Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos. Theophrastus used it for a spiny plant whose identity is not known for sure.[4] Cacti are part of an important food chain in dry, hot climates. Now cacti have spread to many other parts of the world, and many people like to grow them in pots or gardens. Many cacti live in dry places, such as deserts. Most cacti have sharp thorns (stickers) and thick skin. There are many shapes and sizes of cacti. Some are short and round; others are tall and thin. Many cactus flowers are big and beautiful. Some bloom at night and are pollinated by moths and bats. Some cactus fruits are brightly coloured and good to eat: many animals eat cactus fruits.'

        description: 'Having a superficial resemblance to pennyworts and growing 30 cm (12 in) tall and wide, it is an erect, evergreen perennial, with round, dark green, peltate leaves up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter on a long petiole.[3] The stem axis is greenish to dark brown, usually simple, often upright straight, slightly lignified at the base. In poor growing conditions, the plants lose their leaves in the lower part of the branch axis and thereby assume a very distinctive habit. The plants are completely hairless. Striking are their large, circular, shiny, leaves, which can have a diameter of over 15 centimeters (6 in). The petioles are wild growing 5 cm to 45 cm (2 to 17 in) long, in indoor plants up to 30 centimeters (12 in). The flowers are inconspicuous.[4]'

        description: 'Like other aroids, many species of Anthurium can be grown as houseplants, or outdoors in mild climates in shady spots. They include Anthurium species such as Anthurium crystallinum and Anthurium clarinervium with its large, velvety, dark green leaves and silvery white venation. Many hybrids are derived from Anthurium andraeanum or Anthurium scherzerianum because of their colorful spathes. They thrive in moist soils with high organic matter. In milder climates the plants can be grown in pots of soil. Indoors plants thrive at temperatures between 16–22 °C (61–72 °F) and at lower light than other house plants. Wiping the leaves off with water will remove any dust and insects. Plants in pots with good root systems will benefit from a weak fertilizer solution every other week. In the case of vining or climbing Anthuriums, the plants benefit from being provided with a totem to climb.'

        description: 'Begonias are some of the easiest plants to grow in containers. This group of warm-loving plants was originally found in the forest understory in tropical and subtropical areas. Foliage begonias, like rex begonias, are grown for their fancy leaves that have many beautiful colors highlighted by unusual markings and swirls in the foliage. They make a sensational statement when grown on a partially sunlit windowsill. Flowering begonias, like Begonia boliviensis hybrids, are usually grown as annuals in the summer garden.'

        description: 'Most are shrubs or perennial herbaceous plants, but a few are annual or biennial. The largest, Kalanchoe beharensis from Madagascar, can reach 6 m (20 ft) tall, but most species are less than 1 m (3 ft) tall. Kalanchoes are characterized by opening their flowers by growing new cells on the inner surface of the petals to force them outwards, and on the outside of the petals to close them. Kalanchoe flowers are divided into 4 sections with 8 stamens. The petals are fused into a tube, in a similar way to some related genera such as Cotyledon.[4]'

It is a type of plant that prefers indirect lighting, which means makes it perfect for indoor usage and office buildings. Calathea plants are popular for indoor purposes because they are generally easy to care for and they look great, offering bright green plants to liven up indoor spaces. '

        description: 'Asparagus setaceus, commonly called asparagus fern, is not in fact a fern. It is a bushy, evergreen, twining vine with wiry, spiny, scrambling or climbing stems that typically grow to 10-20 long. It features feathery, fern-like flattened sprays of bright green stems, small white summer flowers and deep purple berries. The true leaves of this plant are tiny dry scales. '

        description: 'The large cordate or sagittate leaves grow to a length of 20 to 90 cm on long petioles. Their araceous flowers grow at the end of a short stalk, but are not conspicuous; often hidden behind the leaf petioles. The corms of some species can be processed to make them edible, but the raw plants contain raphid or raphide crystals of calcium oxalate along with other irritants (possibly including proteases)[3] that can numb and swell the tongue and pharynx; they cause difficulty in breathing, and sharp pain in the throat. The lower parts of the plant contain the highest concentrations of the poison. Prolonged boiling before serving or processing may reduce the risks, and acidic fruit such as tamarind may dissolve the raphides. However the species vary in toxicity, and it is dangerous to experiment with the edibility of any Alocasia.'
